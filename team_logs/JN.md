## Project Log By JN

### 02/25/23

Added the icons and text to the header portion of the navbar. Began styling the header with the appropriate colors and positioning. I had to go in to ColorSync Utility and adjust the color of the png logos that needed to be white: Shopping cart logo, and location logo. I created an icons folder in src that can be used as a container for any icons or logos that we will use on the page. 

Will need to work on adding Amazon ember font and adjust sizing and hover options.

### 02/27/23

Added Amazon Ember font to font folder and imported it into App.js and NavBar.css. Styled the Amazon logo and began styling the location.

### 02/28/23

Refactored the jsx for the NavBar component, attempting to follow the layout of the original Amazon site. I left out some elements that we may not use in our mock project that may have been on the original Amazon page. Will section the navbar into two sections: the nav-belt and the nav-bottom-belt. Began updating the style of the nav-belt.
