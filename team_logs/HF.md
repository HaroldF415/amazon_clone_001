Started to set up a repo for the amazon clone website. My team members are Keeanu Rodriguez and Joshua Nelson. I believe with these team members we can complete this project in a two to three week sprint.

Today's meeting was about the restructuring of the project. New directories were created and the team was assigned to different tasks. We decided to use Axios for our API calls. Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React. Axios is a very popular choice for making HTTP requests and is used by many popular JavaScript libraries.
